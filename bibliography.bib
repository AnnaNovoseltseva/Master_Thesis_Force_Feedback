	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) provides both anatomical imaging with excellent soft tissue contrast and functional {MRI} imaging ({fMRI}) of physiological parameters. The last two decades have witnessed the manifestation of increased interest in {MRI}-guided minimally invasive intervention procedures and {fMRI} for rehabilitation and neuroscience research. Accompanying the aspiration to utilize {MRI} to provide imaging feedback during interventions and brain activity for neuroscience study, there is an accumulated effort to utilize force sensors compatible with the {MRI} environment to meet the growing demand of these procedures, with the goal of enhanced interventional safety and accuracy, improved efficacy and rehabilitation outcome. This paper summarizes the fundamental principles, the state of the art development, and challenges of fiber-optic force sensors for {MRI}-guided interventions and rehabilitation. It provides an overview of {MRI}-compatible fiber-optic force sensors based on different sensing principles, including light intensity modulation, wavelength modulation, and phase modulation. Extensive design prototypes are reviewed to illustrate the detailed implementation of these principles. Advantages and disadvantages of the sensor designs are compared and analyzed. A perspective on the future development of fiber-optic sensors is also presented, which may have additional broad clinical applications. Future surgical interventions or rehabilitation will rely on intelligent force sensors to provide situational awareness to augment or complement human perception in these procedures.},

The {QTC} Pill can be considered as soft, flexible material and has extraordinary electrical properties. It has capability of turning into a remarkable material for new era sensor. The piezoresistive experimental test of {QTC} Pill was performed to determine their resistivity characteristics and to evaluate the suitability of {QTC} Pills as tactile sensors. The experiments were conducted based on the sensitivity of the {QTC} Pill. The shows that, the {QTC} Pill was a perfect insulator as well as an extremely good conductor. This has been observed through resistance versus force (R vs F) investigation in which an exponential curve was obtained. This is coherent with the hypothesis of quantum tunneling charge transport within the polymer `assisted' quantum tunneling. The hypothesis is further supported by comparing and contrasting current versus voltage (I vs V) curves. At intermediate pressure, {QTC} Pill exhibits a clearly not linear hysteric behaviour and current fluctuations. These characteristic features can be related to {QTC} Pill specific structure and electron quantum tunneling. Based on this investigation, {QTC} pill are suitable to be used as a material for general tactile device application and can be used as a guideline when designing a tactile sensor with this material.},

However, currently, there is no force sensing and force feedback. Methods This research was implemented using the da Vinci research kit. An external force estimation and implementation method was proposed based on dynamics and motor currents. The dynamics of the Patient Side Manipulator was modeled. The dynamic model was linearly parameterized. The estimation principle of external force was derived. The dynamic parameters were experimentally identified using a least squares method. Results Several experiments including dynamic parameter identification, joint torque estimation, and external force estimation were performed. The results showed that the proposed method could implement force estimation without using a force sensor. Conclusions The force estimation method was proposed and implemented and experimental results showed the method worked and was feasible. This method could be used for force sensing in minimally invasive surgical robotics in the future.},

	abstract = {{BackgroundHaptic} feedback, which enables surgeons to perceive information on interaction forces between instrument and tissue, is deficient in laparoscopic surgery. This information, however, is essential for accurate tissue manipulation and recognition of tissue consistencies. To this end, a laparoscopic grasper with enhanced haptic feedback has been developed: the force reflecting operation instrument ({FROI}). This study tested the effects of enhanced haptic feedback on force control, tissue consistency interpretation, and the associated surgeons’ level of confidence through a randomized controlled crossover experiment.{MethodsA} randomized three-period crossover trial was conducted, in which seven surgical residents and 13 medical students participated. The setup involved a box trainer in which slices of porcine organs (lung, small intestine, or liver) were presented. Participants performed three series of blinded palpation tasks involving three different graspers: the conventional grasper, the {FROI} with enhanced haptic feedback activated, and the {FROI} with enhanced haptic feedback deactivated. In each series, nine pairs of organ tissues were palpated to compare consistencies. The orders of presenting both instruments and tissues were randomized.{ResultsThe} force applied during tissue palpation significantly decreased, by a mean factor of 3.1 with enhanced haptic feedback. Tissue consistency interpretation was significantly improved with more correct assessments and participants answered with significantly more confidence when enhanced haptic feedback was available.{ConclusionThe} availability of enhanced haptic feedback enabled participants to operate with significantly reduced interaction force between instrument and tissues. This observation is expected to have multiple important clinical implications, such as less tissue damage, fewer complications, shorter operation times, and improved ergonomics.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the effect of update rate on the perceived quality of haptic virtual textures, focusing on one type of perceived instability called “buzzing.” Buzzing refers to the high-frequency noises that may emanate from a force-feedback device during haptic texture rendering. We ﬁrst present a simulation of a haptic texture rendering system that explicitly models the sampled-data nature of the system. The simulation shows that a slow haptic update rate can signiﬁcantly increase the high-frequency noise in the reconstructed force command sent to the haptic interface. This noise may excite the structural resonance of the haptic interface and result in a high-frequency buzzing at the interaction tool that a user holds. A subsequent psychophysical experiment, conducted over a wide range of update rate (250 Hz - 40 {kHz}), has conﬁrmed the simulation results. The results show a 278\% increase in the maximum stiffness (0.325 – 0.904 N/mm over the update rates tested) that could be used for rendering perceptually “clean” virtual haptic textures. These results argue for haptic update rates that are much higher than the widely-accepted value of 1 {kHz}. Considering that an application requiring hard surface rendering needs a stiffness value of at least 0.8 – 1.0 N/mm, we recommend a haptic update rate in the range 5 – 10 {kHz} for perceptually stable haptic texture rendering.},

The purpose of this review is to explore current and emerging surgical robotic technologies in a growing and dynamic environment of research and development.{MethodsThis} review explores medical and surgical robotic endoscopic surgery and peripheral technologies currently available or in development. The devices discussed here are specific to general surgery, including laparoscopy, colonoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and thoracoscopy.

Due to the lack of haptic feedback, visual cues are necessary to estimate grip forces and tissue tensions during surgery. We directly measured the grip forces of robotic {EndoWrist}® instruments using the three available da Vinci robotic surgical platforms. Methods: Robotic instruments were tested in the da Vinci S, Si, and Standard systems. A load cell was placed in a housing unit that allowed for measurement of the grip forces applied by the tip of each robotic instrument. Each instrument was tested six times, and all data were analyzed using Student's t-tests or analysis of variance when appropriate. Results: Slight differences in grip force were seen when the instrument was tested through 2 degrees of freedom at the tip (p = 0.02, analysis of variance) and when comparing a new instrument to an older instrument (p = 0.001 at the neutral position). There was no statistical difference in grip force between the left and right robotic arms. There was a broad range of grip forces between the various robotic instruments. The lowest grip force was registered in the double fenestrated grasper (2.26 ± 0.15 N), whereas the highest was seen in the Hem-o-lok® clip applier (39.92 ± 0.89 N). In comparison to the S and Si, the Standard platform appeared to have significantly higher grip forces. Conclusion: Different grip forces were observed among the various robotic instruments commonly used during urologic surgery and between the Standard and the S and Si platforms.},

	abstract = {Background
Direct haptic (force or tactile) feedback is negligible in current surgical robotic systems. The relevance of haptic feedback in robot-assisted performances of surgical tasks is controversial. We studied the effects of visual force feedback ({VFF}), a haptic feedback surrogate, on tying surgical knots with fine sutures similar to those used in cardiovascular surgery.

Methods
Using a modified da Vinci robotic system (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.) equipped with force-sensing instrument tips and real-time {VFF} overlays in the console image, ten surgeons each tied 10 knots with and 10 knots without {VFF}. Four surgeons had significant prior da Vinci experience while the remaining six surgeons did not. Performance parameters, including suture breakage and secure knots, peak and standard deviation of applied forces, and completion times using 5-0 silk sutures were recorded. Chi-square and Student’s t-test analyses determined differences between groups.

Results
Among surgeon subjects with robotic experience, no differences in measured performance parameters were found between robot-assisted knot ties executed with and without {VFF}. Among surgeons without robotic experience, however, {VFF} was associated with lower suture breakage rates, peak applied forces, and standard deviations of applied forces. {VFF} did not impart differences in knot completion times or loose knots for either surgeon group.

Conclusions
{VFF} resulted in reduced suture breakage, lower forces, and decreased force inconsistencies among novice robotic surgeons, although elapsed time and knot quality were unaffected. In contrast, {VFF} did not affect these metrics among experienced da Vinci surgeons. These results suggest that {VFF} primarily benefits novice robot-assisted surgeons, with diminishing benefits among experienced surgeons.},

	abstract = {Background
Virtual reality ({VR}) as surgical training tool has become a state-of-the-art technique in training and teaching skills for minimally invasive surgery ({MIS}). Although intuitively appealing, the true benefits of haptic ({VR} training) platforms are unknown. Many questions about haptic feedback in the different areas of surgical skills (training) need to be answered before adding costly haptic feedback in {VR} simulation for {MIS} training. This study was designed to review the current status and value of haptic feedback in conventional and robot-assisted {MIS} and training by using virtual reality simulation.

Methods
A systematic review of the literature was undertaken using {PubMed} and {MEDLINE}. The following search terms were used: Haptic feedback {OR} Haptics {OR} Force feedback {AND}/{OR} Minimal Invasive {SurgeryAND}/{OR} Minimal Access Surgery {AND}/{OR} Robotics {AND}/{OR} Robotic Surgery {AND}/{OR} Endoscopic Surgery {AND}/{OR} Virtual Reality {AND}/{OR} Simulation {OR} Surgical Training/Education.

Results
The results were assessed according to level of evidence as reflected by the Oxford Centre of Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence.

Conclusions
In the current literature, no firm consensus exists on the importance of haptic feedback in performing minimally invasive surgery. Although the majority of the results show positive assessment of the benefits of force feedback, results are ambivalent and not unanimous on the subject. Benefits are least disputed when related to surgery using robotics, because there is no haptic feedback in currently used robotics. The addition of haptics is believed to reduce surgical errors resulting from a lack of it, especially in knot tying. Little research has been performed in the area of robot-assisted endoscopic surgical training, but results seem promising. Concerning {VR} training, results indicate that haptic feedback is important during the early phase of psychomotor skill acquisition.},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review
Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery ({RMIS}) holds great promise for improving the accuracy and dexterity of a surgeon while minimizing trauma to the patient. However, widespread clinical success with {RMIS} has been marginal. It is hypothesized that the lack of haptic (force and tactile) feedback presented to the surgeon is a limiting factor. This review explains the technical challenges of creating haptic feedback for robot-assisted surgery and provides recent results that evaluate the effectiveness of haptic feedback in mock surgical tasks.

Recent Findings
Haptic feedback systems for {RMIS} are still under development and evaluation. Most provide only force feedback, with limited fidelity. The major challenge at this time is sensing forces applied to the patient. A few tactile feedback systems for {RMIS} have been created, but their practicality for clinical implementation needs to be shown. It is particularly difficult to sense and display spatially distributed tactile information. The cost-benefit ratio for haptic feedback in {RMIS} has not been established.

Summary
The designs of existing commercial {RMIS} systems are not conducive for force feedback, and creative solutions are needed to create compelling tactile feedback systems. Surgeons, engineers, and neuroscientists should work together to develop effective solutions for haptic feedback in {RMIS}.},

	abstract = {Objective

The primary objectives of this rapid assessment were to assess the clinical evidence of Da Vinci surgical system ({DVSS}) comparing with open procedures and laparoscopic procedures, and in order to provide the evidence for health decision makers and clinician.


Methods

A comprehensive search of electronic databases ({EMbase}, {PubMed}, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, {CNKI}, {VIP}, {CBM} and Wanfang) and {HTA} websites were completed up to 9 October, 2013. Two reviews (Jiajie Yu and Yingqiang Wang) independently extracted data of the manuscripts, and assessed quality of included studies using {AMSTAR} tools. Qualitative description and {GRADE} were used to report the outcomes and evidence quality.


Outcomes

A total of 17 studies were included: 3 were {HTA} and 14 were {SR}/meta-analysis. The included studies focused on prostatectomy, nephrectomy, hysterectomy colorectal surgery, and cardiac surgery. {DVSS} was shown to be associated with statistically significant reduction in length of hospital stay, blood loss, and transfusion rate compared with open and laparoscopic surgery, but increase in operative time when compared with open surgery.


Conclusion

Based on the evidence included in this rapid assessment, {DVSS} has a limited impact on several clinical outcomes. Considering no available data from randomized controlled trials and much higher cost, decisions will be complex and need to be made carefully. Decision makers should cut down the quantity of purchasing and reasonable allocate them.},

For the design of the compliant forceps, the required compliance characteristics are first defined using a simple spring model with one linear and one torsional springs. This model may be directly realized as the compliant forceps. However, for the compact realization of the mechanism, we synthesize the spring model with two torsional springs that has equivalent compliance characteristics to the linear-torsional spring model. Then, each of the synthesized torsional springs is realized physically by means of a flexure hinge. From this design approach, direct measurement of the pulling and grasp forces is possible at the forceps, and measuring sensitivity can be adjusted in the synthesis process. The validity of the design is evaluated by finite element analysis. Further, from the measured values of bending strains of two flexure hinges, a method to compute the decoupled pulling and grasp forces is presented via the theory of screws. Finally, force-sensing performance of the proposed compliant forceps is verified from the experiments of the prototype using some weights and load cells.},

Method In this paper a force‐feedback enabled surgical robotic system is described in which the developed force‐sensing surgical tool is discussed in detail. The developed surgical tool makes use of a proximally located force/torque sensor, which, in contrast to a distally located sensor, requires no miniaturization or sterilizability. Results Experimental results are presented, and indicate high force sensing accuracies with errors <0.09 N.

	abstract = {Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgeries have gained a lot of popularity over conventional procedures as they offer many benefits to both surgeons and patients. Nonetheless, they still suffer from some limitations that affect their outcome. One of them is the lack of force feedback which restricts the surgeon's sense of touch and might reduce precision during a procedure. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel force estimation approach that combines a vision based solution with supervised learning to estimate the applied force and provide the surgeon with a suitable representation of it. The proposed solution starts with extracting the geometry of motion of the heart's surface by minimizing an energy functional to recover its 3D deformable structure. A deep network, based on a {LSTM}-{RNN} architecture, is then used to learn the relationship between the extracted visual-geometric information and the applied force, and to find accurate mapping between the two. Our proposed force estimation solution avoids the drawbacks usually associated with force sensing devices, such as biocompatibility and integration issues. We evaluate our approach on phantom and realistic tissues in which we report an average root-mean square error of 0.02 N.},

	abstract = {In robot assisted laparoscopic surgery using a commercialized robot, such as the da Vinci, surgeons have encountered problems, such as organ impairment, because they depend only on visual information. To solve these problems, a haptic system is required. Force feedback and a bilateral control system are essential for realizing a haptic teleoperation system. The use of a force/torque sensor for force feedback is difficult in a surgical robot instrument, but previous studies confirmed that the reaction force loaded on a surgical robot instrument can be estimated using a sliding perturbation observer ({SPO})-based reaction force estimation method. This paper suggests a bilateral controller applying {SPO} based force estimation method to realize the possibility of a haptic function in a laparoscopic surgery robot system. In the suggested bilateral controller, the master control uses impedance control and the slave control uses a sliding mode control ({SMC}). A torque and force sensorless teleoperation system can be implemented using the suggested bilateral control structure through an experimental evaluation.},

	abstract = {{BackgroundRobotic} surgical platforms have seen increased use among minimally invasive gastrointestinal surgeons (von Fraunhofer et al. in J Biomed Mater Res 19(5):595–600, 1985. doi: 10.1002/jbm.820190511). However, these systems still suffer from lack of haptic feedback, which results in exertion of excessive force, often leading to suture failures (Barbash et al. in Ann Surg 259(1):1–6, 2014. doi: 10.1097/{SLA}.0b013e3182a5c8b8). This work catalogs tensile strength and failure load among commonly used sutures in an effort to prevent robotic surgical consoles from exceeding identified thresholds. Trials were thus conducted on common sutures varying in material type, gauge size, rate of pulling force, and method of applied force.{MethodsPolydioxanone}, Silk, Vicryl, and Prolene, gauges 5-0 to 1-0, were pulled till failure using a commercial mechanical testing system. 2-0 and 3-0 sutures were further tested for the effect of pull rate on failure load at rates of 50, 200, and 400 mm/min. 3-0 sutures were also pulled till failure using a da Vinci robotic surgical system in unlooped, looped, and at the needle body arrangements.{ResultsGenerally}, Vicryl and {PDS} sutures had the highest mechanical strength (47–179 {kN}/cm2), while Silk had the lowest (40–106 {kN}/cm2). Larger diameter sutures withstand higher total force, but finer gauges consistently show higher force per unit area. The difference between material types becomes increasingly significant as the diameters decrease. Comparisons of identical suture materials and gauges show 27–50\% improvement in the tensile strength over data obtained in 1985 (Ballantyne in Surg Endosc Other Interv Tech 16(10):1389–1402, 2002. doi: 10.1007/s00464-001-8283-7). No significant differences were observed when sutures were pulled at different rates. Reduction in suture strength appeared to be strongly affected by the technique used to manipulate the suture.{ConclusionsAvailability} of suture tensile strength and failure load data will help define software safety protocols for alerting a surgeon prior to suture failure during robotic surgery. Awareness of suture strength weakening with direct instrument manipulation may lead to the development of better techniques to further reduce intraoperative suture breakage.},

	abstract = {In minimally invasive surgery ({MIS}) the patient's skin forms a spatial barrier between the operation area and the surgeon. This prevents direct access to the operation site which causes a lack of dexterity and limits the sensation of tissue manipulation forces, therefore complicating {MIS} procedures significantly. A telepresence approach can overcome these limitations: Additional degrees of freedom ({DoF}) inside the patient provide full manipulability and force torque sensors at the distal end of the instrument allow precise measurement of interaction forces. Using a suitable man-machine interface and free cartesian motion kinaesthetic feedback can be achieved, thus providing a virtual open surgery environment to the surgeon. This article focuses on the development and first results of actuated and sensor integrated instruments as part of the {DLR} minimally invasive robotic surgery ({MIRS}) setup. The instruments as a front-end part of the {MIRS} setup form one base of a telepresence working environment and are crucial for semi-autonomous functions, e.g. motion compensation.
