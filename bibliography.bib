	have been instigated by a relatively common medical procedure: low-dose
	rate brachytherapy of the prostate. The manipulator can perform orientation,
	insertion, and rotation of the needle and linear motion of the stylet
	to drop radioactive seeds contained in a thin hollow needle (cannula)
	at targeted locations. The key features of the manipulator such as
	backdrivable joints, a fault-tolerant needle driver, stationary actuators,
	and redundant sensors enhance overall safety and reliability of the
	mechanism, a critical requirement for surgical manipulators. The
	manipulator is an integral part of a system utilizing a mechanically
	rotated side-firing transducer to create 3-D ultrasound images of
	the organ and utilizing 3-D SLICER software to visualize those images.
	Experimental results in agar phantoms prove that the manipulator
	is capable of positioning the needle tip at the targeted locations
	with good accuracy. &copy; 2009 IEEE.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the necessity of preoperative evaluation of
	pubic arch interference in patients with small prostate volumes.
	METHODS AND MATERIALS: CT scans from 97 consecutive, unselected patients
	with stage T1 or T2 prostatic carcinoma who had transperineal I-125
	or Pd-103 implants at the University of Washington in 1997 were analyzed
	for pubic arch interference. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) was performed
	with 6.0-MHz transducer with the patient in the lithotomy position
	and the patient's thighs vertical, similar to that used during the
	implant procedure. CT scans were obtained with the patient in the
	supine position, with 0.5-cm images taken at every 0.5 cm. To check
	for potential arch interference, the largest prostate cross-section
	was overlaid on the narrowest portion of the pubic arch. The overlap
	of the pubic arch and the prostate margin is measured at right angles
	to the inner pubic surface. The prostate volume obtained from the
	TRUS images was compared with the degree of pubic arch interference
	in order to determine whether TRUS volume predicted for interference.
	RESULTS: There was considerable variability in pubic arch interference
	between patients. The mm of pubic arch overlap with the prostatic
	margin varied from -11 mm to 20 mm. Patients with larger prostate
	volumes generally had more pubic arch interference, but the degree
	of interference was only loosely related to the prostate volume (r
	= 0.46). CONCLUSIONS: The degree of pubic arch interference is highly
	variable from one patient to the next and the TRUS volume cannot
	reliably predict patients who do or do not need a pelvic CT to detect
	potential arch interference.},

	image (MRI)-guided core needle biopsy of the prostate. MATERIALS
	AND METHODS: A total of 10 biopsies were performed with 18-gauge
	(G) core biopsy needle via a percutaneous transperineal approach.
	Needle placement error was assessed by comparing the coordinates
	of preplanned targets with the needle tip measured from the intraprocedural
	coherent gradient echo images. The source of these errors was subsequently
	investigated by measuring displacement caused by needle deflection
	and needle susceptibility artifact shift in controlled phantom studies.
	Needle placement error due to misalignment of the needle template
	guide was also evaluated. RESULTS: The mean and standard deviation
	(SD) of errors in targeted biopsies was 6.5 +/- 3.5 mm. Phantom experiments
	showed significant placement error due to needle deflection with
	a needle with an asymmetrically beveled tip (3.2-8.7 mm depending
	on tissue type) but significantly smaller error with a symmetrical
	bevel (0.6-1.1 mm). Needle susceptibility artifacts observed a shift
	of 1.6 +/- 0.4 mm from the true needle axis. Misalignment of the
	needle template guide contributed an error of 1.5 +/- 0.3 mm. CONCLUSION:
	Needle placement error was clinically significant in MRI-guided biopsy
	for diagnosis of prostate cancer. Needle placement error due to needle
	deflection was the most significant cause of error, especially for
	needles with an asymmetrical bevel.},

	procedures to be performed with unencoded, unregistered, minimally
	calibrated robots while removing the constraint of placing the needle
	tip on a mechanically enforced Remote Center of Motion (RCM). MATERIALS
	AND METHODS: The algorithm requires only online tracking of the surgical
	tool and a five-degree-of-freedom (5-DOF) robot comprising three
	prismatic DOF and two rotational DOF. An incremental adaptive motion
	control cycle guides the needle to the insertion point and also orients
	it to align with the target-entry-point line. The robot executes
	RCM motion without having a physically constrained fulcrum point.
	RESULTS: The proof-of-concept prototype system achieved 0.78 mm translation
	accuracy and 1.4 degrees rotational accuracy (this is within the
	tracker accuracy) within 17 iterative steps (0.5-1 s). CONCLUSION:
	This research enables robotic assistant systems for image-guided
	percutaneous procedures to be prototyped/constructed more quickly
	and less expensively than has been previously possible. Since the
	clinical utility of such systems is clear and has been demonstrated

	when the collecting system is not distended. Precise entry into a
	selected calyx facilitates subsequent percutaneous manipulations,
	but this skill requires extensive experience. In an attempt to improve
	accuracy while decreasing technical challenges, we developed a robotic
	system that automates the task of fluoroscopic image-guided percutaneous
	needle placement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prototype system consisted
	of a three degree-of-freedom robot with a needle injector end-effector.
	Imaging was provided by a biplanar fluoroscope. After correction
	of image distortion and fluoroscope calibration, robot to image-space
	registration was completed. To validate the system's ability to insert
	a needle into a calyx, ex vivo porcine kidneys suspended in agarose
	gel and distended with iodinated contrast solution were used as a
	model. In situ renal access tests with three 20 kg. pigs were performed.
	Access was confirmed by passing a flexible wire or aspirating iodinated
	contrast from the collecting system. RESULTS: The diameter of target
	calyces ranged from 3 to 7 mm. The in vitro accuracy of final needle
	tip positioning was 0.43 mm. In the ex vivo model, successful "one
	stick" access occurred on 10 of 12 attempts (83\%). In situ access
	on the first attempt was successful for 6 of 12 target calyces (50\%).
	Needle or tissue deflection accounted for each failure. CONCLUSION:
	The feasibility of a robotic system to assist in the percutaneous
	access of small and delicate renal calyces has been demonstrated.
	Additional work in reducing procedural steps and correcting for tissue
	deflection during needle passage is necessary to improve accuracy
	and to allow for clinical application.},

	different sets of image intensities were obtained: T2-weighted (T2W)
	from T2-weighted imaging, Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) from
	LSDI, and proton density (PD) and T2 (T2 Map) from T2-mapping imaging.
	Manually segmented tumor labels from a radiologist, which were validated
	by biopsy results, served as tumor "ground truth." Textural features
	were extracted from the images using co-occurrence matrix (CM) and
	discrete cosine transform (DCT). Anatomical location of voxels was
	described by a cylindrical coordinate system. A statistical jack-knife
	approach was used to evaluate our classifiers. Single-channel maximum
	likelihood (ML) classifiers were based on 1 of the 4 basic image
	intensities. Our multichannel classifiers: support vector machine
	(SVM) and Fisher linear discriminant (FLD), utilized five different
	sets of derived features. Each classifier generated a summary statistical
	map that indicated tumor likelihood in the peripheral zone (PZ) of
	the prostate gland. To assess classifier accuracy, the average areas
	under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves over all
	subjects were compared. Our best FLD classifier achieved an average
	ROC area of 0.839(+/-0.064), and our best SVM classifier achieved
	an average ROC area of 0.761(+/-0.043). The T2W ML classifier, our
	best single-channel classifier, only achieved an average ROC area
	of 0.599(+/-0.146). Compared to the best single-channel ML classifier,
	our best multichannel FLD and SVM classifiers have statistically
	superior ROC performance (P=0.0003 and 0.0017, respectively) from
	pairwise two-sided t-test. By integrating the information from multiple

	areas, summary statistical maps can potentially aid in image-guided
	prostate biopsy and assist in guiding and controlling delivery of
	localized therapy under image guidance.},

	well recognized in the clinical and technical community. Precision,
	accuracy and the potential for telesurgery are the prime motivations
	in applying advanced robot technology in surgery. In this paper critical
	interactions between Magnetic Resonance Imaging equipment and mechatronic
	devices are discussed and a novel Magnetic Resonance compatible surgical
	robot is described. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Experimental results of
	the effects from several passive (metallic materials) and active
	(ultrasound motors) mechanical elements are demonstrated. The design
	principles for Magnetic Resonance compatible robots are established
	and the compatibility of the proposed robot is assessed by comparing
	images taken with and without the robot's presence within Signa SP/I
	GE Medical Systems scanner. RESULTS: The results showed that, in
	principle, it is possible to construct precision mechatronic devices
	intended to operate inside MR scanner. Use of such a device will
	not cause image shift or significant degradation of signal-to-noise-ratio.
	An MR compatible surgical assist robot was designed and constructed.
	The robot is not affected by the presence of strong magnetic fields
	and is able to manoeuvre during imaging without compromising the
	quality of images. A novel image-guided robot control scheme was
	proposed. As a part of the control scheme, biomechanics-based organ
	deformation model was constructed and validated by in-vivo experiment.
	It has been recognised that for robust control of an image guided
	surgical robot the precise knowledge of the mechanical properties
	of soft organs operated on must be known. As an illustration, results
	in mathematical modelling and computer simulation of brain deformation
	are given. CONCLUSION: The novel MR compatible robot was designed
	to position and direct an axisymmetric tool, such as a laser pointer

	with MRI, CT, fluoroscopy, and ultrasound imaging devices. The details
	of each system are given along with any phantom, animal, or human
	trials. The systems include the AcuBot for active needle insertion
	under CT or fluoroscopy, the B-Rob systems for needle placement using
	CT or ultrasound, the INNOMOTION for MRI and CT interventions, and
	the MRBot for MRI procedures. Following these descriptions, the technology
	issues of image compatibility, registration, patient movement and
	respiration, force feedback, and control mode are briefly discussed.
	It is our belief that robotic systems will be an important part of
	future interventions, but more research and clinical trials are needed.
	The possibility of performing new clinical procedures that the human
	cannot achieve remains an ultimate goal for medical robotics. Engineers
	and physicians should work together to create and validate these
	systems for the benefits of patients everywhere.},

	impact to survival or quality of life were treatment deferred. We
	sought to characterize temporal trends in clinical presentation and
	primary disease management among patients with low-risk prostate
	cancer. METHODS: Data were abstracted from the Cancer of the Prostate
	Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE), a disease registry
	of 8,685 men with various stages of prostate cancer. Included were
	2,078 men who were diagnosed between 1989 and 2001 and had a serum
	prostate specific antigen </= 10 ng/mL, Gleason sum </= 6, and clinical
	T stage </= 2a. Trends in risk distribution, tumor characteristics,
	and primary treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: The proportion of
	patients with low-risk tumor characteristics rose from 29.8\% in
	1989 to 1992, to 45.3\% in 1999 to 2001 (P <.0001). There have been
	sharp increases in the use of brachytherapy and androgen deprivation
	monotherapy, from 3.1\% and 3.1\%, to 12.0\% and 21.7\%, respectively.
	Utilization rates for prostatectomy, external-beam radiotherapy,
	and observation have fallen accordingly, from 63.8\%, 16.1\%, and
	13.8\%, to 51.6\%, 6.8\%, and 7.9\% (P <.0001 for all except prostatectomy
	[P =.0019]). Age and socioeconomic status were significantly associated
	with treatment selection, but overall, the treatment trends were
	echoed on subgroup analysis of patients 75 years or older. CONCLUSION:
	Low-risk features characterize a growing proportion of prostate cancer
	patients, and there have been significant shifts in the management
	of low-risk disease. Overtreatment may be a growing problem, especially
	among older patients.},

	(IMR)-guided implant technique with real-time dosimetric feedback
	is presented. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The work was carried out at
	a IMR unit at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Planning and dosimetric
	feedback were provided by a software system that provides an interface
	to the IMR images, anatomy demarcation, template registration, dose
	calculation engine for planning, and evaluating the implant. Planning
	during the procedure permits the incorporation of actual needle trajectories
	in the dose calculations. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were planned
	in the treatment position. During source placement, actual needle
	locations were incorporated into the dose calculations. After accounting
	for the observed needle trajectories of the planned needles, 14 of
	15 patients (93\%) required additional sources to achieve the desired
	coverage of the target volume. CONCLUSION: A brachytherapy implant
	procedure which provides clinically significant advances has been
	implemented. Specifically, the planning system allows dosimetric
	validation of the needle placement. This procedure is effective in
	delivering brachytherapy to the target volume and assuring that the
	implant is delivered in accordance with the preplan. The dosimetric

	select patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. METHODS
	AND MATERIALS: Nine patients with 1997 American Joint Commission
	on Cancer (AJCC) clinical stage T1cNxM0 prostate cancer, prostate-specific
	antigen (PSA) < 10 ng/ml, biopsy Gleason score not exceeding 3 +
	4, and endorectal coil MR stage T2 disease were enrolled into this
	study. The prescribed minimum peripheral dose was 160 Gy to the clinical
	target volume (CTV), which was the MR-defined peripheral zone (PZ)
	of the prostate gland. Using a real-time 0.5 Tesla intraoperative
	MR imaging unit, 5-mm image planes were obtained throughout the prostate
	gland. The PZ of the prostate gland, anterior rectal wall, and prostatic
	urethra were identified on the T2 weighted axial images by an MR
	radiologist. An optimized treatment plan for catheter insertion was
	generated intraoperatively. Each catheter containing the 125Iodine
	sources was placed under real-time MR guidance to ensure that its
	position in the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes was in agreement
	with the planned trajectory. Real-time dose- volume histogram analyses
	were used intraoperatively to optimize the dosimetry. RESULTS: For
	the 9 study patients, 89-99\% (median 94\%) of the CTV received a
	minimum peripheral dose of 160 Gy and > or = 95\% of the volume of
	the prostatic urethra and 42-89\% (median 70\%) of the volume of
	the anterior rectal wall received doses that were below the reported
	tolerance. All patients voided spontaneously within 3 h after discontinuation
	of the Foley catheter and no patient required more than a limited
	course (< or = 3 weeks) of oral alpha-1 blockers for postimplant
	urethritis. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time MR-guided interstitial radiation
	therapy provided the ability to achieve the planned optimized dose-volume
	histogram profiles to the CTV and healthy juxtaposed structures intraoperatively,

	obtained under real time MRI guidance from the peripheral zone of
	the prostate gland as well as a single core from each MRI defined
	lesion. The patient had previously undergone proctocolectomy for

	In this randomized-pairs trial, we enrolled 156 patients with advanced
	Parkinson's disease and severe motor symptoms. The primary end points
	were the changes from baseline to six months in the quality of life,
	as assessed by the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), and
	the severity of symptoms without medication, according to the Unified
	Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, part III (UPDRS-III). RESULTS:
	Pairwise comparisons showed that neurostimulation, as compared with
	medication alone, caused greater improvements from baseline to six
	months in the PDQ-39 (50 of 78 pairs, P=0.02) and the UPDRS-III (55
	of 78, P<0.001), with mean improvements of 9.5 and 19.6 points, respectively.
	Neurostimulation resulted in improvements of 24 to 38 percent in
	the PDQ-39 subscales for mobility, activities of daily living, emotional
	well-being, stigma, and bodily discomfort. Serious adverse events
	were more common with neurostimulation than with medication alone
	(13 percent vs. 4 percent, P<0.04) and included a fatal intracerebral
	hemorrhage. The overall frequency of adverse events was higher in
	the medication group (64 percent vs. 50 percent, P=0.08). CONCLUSIONS:
	In this six-month study of patients under 75 years of age with severe
	motor complications of Parkinson's disease, neurostimulation of the
	subthalamic nucleus was more effective than medical management alone.

	principle and remote manual actuation. Progress has been made concerning
	material selection, position sensing, and different actuation techniques,
	and design strategies have been implemented to overcome the multiple
	restrictions imposed by the MRI environment. Most systems lack the

	first MRI compatible needles for use in a surgical robot. New in
	the field of NiTi is the porous foam and its compatibility to human
	cells and first results show new possibilities in growing artificial
	cells. In combination with the elasticity of the foam a new generation
	of e.g. medical bone implants could be possible. This paper describes
	several developments in the field of instruments of shape memory
	alloys (SMAs) made also at Endosmart.},

  abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides three dimensional (3D) imaging
	with excellent resolution and sensitivity for guiding and monitoring
	interventions and for functional imaging.
	
	The development of MRI-compatible intervention devices is complicated
	by several factors: the high magnetic fields of the scanners, the
	requirement that such devices should not degrade the quality of the
	MR images, and by the confined physical space of the scanners.
	
	This paper reports an experimental evaluation of the following three
	different MRI-compatible actuators: the Shinsei ultrasonic motor,
	the Nanomotion ultrasonic motor and a pneumatic cylinder actuator.
	
	We report the results of a study comparing the effect of
	
	these actuators on the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of MRI images under
	a variety of experimental conditions.
	
	Evaluation was performed with the controller inside and outside the
	scanner room and with both 1.5T and 3T MR scanners.
	
	The pneumatic cylinders function with no loss of SNR with controller
	both inside and outside of the scanner room, the Nanomotion motor
	performs with moderate loss of SNR when moving during imaging, and
	the Shinsei is unsuitable for motion during imaging but may be used
	when appropriately interleaved with imaging cycles. A detailed comparison
	of the motors' compatibility in the different configurations is described
	using four popular MRI sequences for diagnostic, real-time and functional

	of angulated needles to the total number of needles increased, while
	the dosimetry outcomes only had a slight trend of worsening. When

	Therefore, for moderate PAI the hybrid dosimetry is feasible.},

	a novel method of controlling motor experiments in the scanner using
	feedback of EMG. Because of the redundancy in the human muscle system,
	this is not possible from recordings of joint torque and kinematics
	alone, because these provide no information about individual muscle
	activation. This is particularly critical during brain imaging because
	brain activations are not only related to joint torques and kinematics
	but are also related to individual muscle activation. However, EMG
	collected during imaging is corrupted by large artifacts induced
	by the varying magnetic fields and radio frequency (RF) pulses in
	the scanner. Methods proposed in literature for artifact removal
	are complex, computationally expensive, and difficult to implement
	for real-time noise removal. We describe an acquisition system and
	algorithm that enables real-time acquisition for the first time.
	The algorithm removes particular frequencies from the EMG spectrum
	in which the noise is concentrated. Although this decreases the power
	content of the EMG, this method provides excellent estimates of EMG
	with good resolution. Comparisons show that the cleaned EMG obtained
	with the algorithm is, like actual EMG, very well correlated with
	joint torque and can thus be used for real-time visual feedback during
	functional studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This paper presents a magnetic resonance (MR) compatible
	joystick for controlling a surgical robot arm. The surgical robot
	can be used to assist the surgeon in high precision neurosurgery
	tasks. Conventional joysticks cannot be used in magnetic resonance
	imaging (MRI) environments, because they generally contain ferromagnetic
	materials such as iron, which create distortions in MR images. Moreover,
	dangerous situations may arise, when an object containing ferromagnetic
	materials passes through the strong magnetic field of an imaging
	device. Currents generated by device electronics produce magnetic
	fields that distort MR images. METHODS: Operation of the joystick
	described here is based on measuring light intensity. Optical fibres
	are used for target illumination and for transmitting the reflected
	light. Their use enables the joystick electronics to be kept at a
	safe distance from the imaging machine. RESULTS: Experimental results
	prove that the joystick can be constructed on the presented operating
	principle using the designed mechanical structure. When the joystick
	was placed 15 cm away from the phantom object, it didn't cause any
	distortion to the MR image. CONCLUSIONS: The developed joystick can
	be used in an MRI environment. However, further development need
	to be done in order to avoid losses caused by bending optical fibres.},

	AND METHODS: Actuation of robots in an MRI environment is difficult
	due to the presence of strong magnetic fields. Therefore, the robot
	was constructed of nonmagnetic materials. The system frame was built
	from polyether ether ketone (PEEK) and fiber-reinforced epoxy, and
	actuated using ultrasonic and pneumatic motors. Completely MR-compatible
	sensors were developed for positioning control. RESULTS: Accuracy
	evaluation procedures and phantom tests were performed, with the
	required accuracy of approximately 1 mm being achieved and no significant
	artifacts being caused by the robotic device during MR image acquisition.},

	may mask changes in death rates from specific conditions. OBJECTIVE:
	To examine temporal trends in the age-standardized death rates and
	in the number of deaths from the 6 leading causes of death in the
	United States. DESIGN AND SETTING: Analyses of vital statistics data
	on mortality in the United States from 1970 to 2002. MAIN OUTCOME
	MEASURE: The age-standardized death rate and number of deaths (coded
	as underlying cause) from each of the 6 leading causes of death:
	heart disease, stroke, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
	accidents (ie, related to transportation [motor vehicle, other land
	vehicles, and water, air, and space] and not related to transportation
	[falls, fire, and accidental posioning]), and diabetes mellitus.
	RESULTS: The age-standardized death rate (per 100,000 per year) from
	all causes combined decreased from 1242 in 1970 to 845 in 2002. The
	largest percentage decreases were in death rates from stroke (63\%),
	heart disease (52\%), and accidents (41\%). The largest absolute
	decreases in death rates were from heart disease (262 deaths per
	100,000), stroke (96 deaths per 100,000), and accidents (26 deaths
	per 100,000).The death rate from all types of cancer combined increased
	between 1970 and 1990 and then decreased through 2002, yielding a
	net decline of 2.7\%. In contrast, death rates doubled from chronic
	obstructive pulmonary disease over the entire time interval and increased
	by 45\% for diabetes since 1987. Despite decreases in age-standardized
	death rates from 4 of the 6 leading causes of death, the absolute
	number of deaths from these conditions continues to increase, although
	these deaths occur at older ages. CONCLUSIONS: The absolute number
	of deaths and age at death continue to increase in the United States.
	These temporal trends have major implications for health care and
	health care costs in an aging population.},

	space. A stereotaxically directed and computer-monitored CO2 laser
	is then utilized to vaporize that volume as the surgeon monitors
	the position of a cursor representing the laser beam against planar
	contours of the tumor displayed on an operating room computer monitor.
	Computer-assisted stereotaxic laser microsurgery provides precise
	three-dimensional control for aggressive resection of deep-seated
	tumors from neurologically important areas with acceptable postoperative
	results. Thus, a significant cytoreduction can be achieved in addition
	to providing a tissue diagnosis and internal decompression. The authors
	report 83 computer-assisted stereotaxic laser procedures for tumor
	excision in 78 patients. The tumors were located in the thalamus/basal
	ganglia in 15 patients, ventricular system in five, corpus callosum
	in four, brain stem in three, and deep and centrally in the hemispheres
	in 51. Histologically, there were 26 glioblastomas, seven grade III
	astrocytomas, 14 grade II astrocytomas, 14 metastatic tumors, nine
	vascular lesions, and eight miscellaneous lesions. Resection of these
	subcortical lesions was confirmed by postoperative contrast-enhanced
	CT scanning. Neurological examinations performed 1 week after the
	83 procedures revealed that 48 patients had improved from their preoperative
	level and 23 were unchanged (12 were neurologically normal preoperatively).
	Twelve patients had an increase in a preoperative neurological deficit,
	three of whom died in the postoperative period: one from infection,
	one from pulmonary emboli, and one from brain-stem edema. The average
	survival period (37.6 weeks) of patients having glioblastomas treated
	by this technique and irradiation was no different from that of patients
	having glioblastomas in more favorable locations treated by conventional
	surgery and irradiation. Patients with circumscribed lower-grade
	astrocytomas did better in terms of morbidity and completeness of
	resection than those with infiltrative neoplasms. Other circumscribed
	lesions, such as metastatic tumors, vascular lesions, and intraventricular
	tumors, were easily resected by the technique described.},

	with the imager. Precision tests in tissue mockups yielded a mean
	seed placement error of 0.72 +/- 0.36 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The robotic
	system is fully MRI compatible. The new technology allows for automated
	and highly accurate operation within MRI scanners and does not deteriorate
	the MRI quality. We believe that this robot may become a useful instrument
	for image-guided prostate interventions.},

	In this paper two control algorithms are designed for the pneumatic

	first algorithm uses position plus velocity plus acceleration feedback
	combined with feedfoward and deadzone compensation (PVA+FF+DZC).

	experiments using different payloads (1.9, 5.8 and 10.8 kg), vertical
	and horizontal movements, and move sizes from 3 to 250 mm were conducted.
	Averaged over 70 experiments with various operating conditions, the
	tracking error for SMC was 59% less than with PVA+FF+DZC. For a 5.8
	kg payload and a 0.5 Hz, 70 mm amplitude, sine wave reference trajectory

	in a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner in patients with
	elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels and recent negative
	transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsies. PATIENTS
	AND METHODS: Between July 2004 and November 2005, patients with at
	least one previous negative prostate biopsy within the previous 12
	months had MRI-guided biopsy of the prostate in a 3-T MRI scanner.
	Patients with previous positive biopsies for cancer were excluded.
	Target selection was based on T2-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced
	(DCE) imaging studies. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were eligible;
	their median (range) age was 61 (47-74) years and PSA value 4.90
	(1.3-12.3) ng/mL. Most patients had one previous negative biopsy
	(range 1-4). Four patients had a family history of prostate cancer.
	There were 37 distinct targets based on T2-weighted imaging. Fifteen
	of 16 distinct DCE abnormalities were co-localized with a target
	based on T2-weighted imaging. Despite this correlation, only one
	of 13 patients had a directed biopsy positive for cancer. Including
	systematic biopsies, two of 13 patients had a biopsy positive for
	prostate cancer. One patient had prostate intraepithelial neoplasia
	and one had atypical glands in the specimen. CONCLUSION: The prostate-cancer
	yield of transrectal biopsies in a 3-T MRI scanner, among patients
	with recent negative TRUS-guided prostate biopsies, is similar to
	repeat systematic TRUS-guided biopsy. DCE correlates with T2-imaging
	but does not appear to improve prostate cancer yield in this population.},

	(STN) is a procedure that is rapidly gaining acceptance for the treatment
	of symptoms in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), but there are
	few detailed descriptions of the surgical procedure itself. The authors
	present the technical approach used to implant 76 stimulators into
	the STNs of patients with PD and the lead locations, which were verified
	on postoperative magnetic resonance (MR) images. METHODS: Implantation
	procedures were performed with the aid of stereotactic MR imaging,
	microelectrode recording (MER) in the region of the stereotactic
	target to define the motor area of the STN, and intraoperative test
	stimulation to assess the thresholds for stimulation-induced adverse
	effects. All patients underwent postoperative MR imaging, which was
	performed using volumetric gradient-echo and T2-weighted fast-spin
	echo techniques, computational reformatting of the MR image into
	standard anatomical planes, and quantitative measurements of lead
	location with respect to the midcommissural point and the red nucleus.
	Lead locations were statistically correlated with physiological data
	obtained during MER and intraoperative test stimulation. CONCLUSIONS:
	The authors' approach to implantation of DBS leads into the STN was
	associated with consistent lead placement in the dorsolateral STN,
	a low rate of morbidity, efficient use of operating room time, and
	robust improvement in motor function. The mean coordinates of the
	middle of the electrode array, measured on postoperative MR images,
	were 11.6 mm lateral, 2.9 mm posterior, and 4.7 mm inferior to the
	midcommissural point, and 6.5 mm lateral and 3.5 mm anterior to the
	center of the red nucleus. Voltage thresholds for several types of
	stimulation-induced adverse effects were predictive of lead location.
	Technical nuances of the surgery are described in detail.},

  abstract = {Today's most successful surgical robots are perhaps surgeon-driven
	systems, such as the daVinci (Intuitive Surgical Inc., USA, www.intuitivesurgical.com).
	These have already enabled surgery that was unattainable with classic
	instrumentation; however, at their present level of development,
	they have limited utility. The drawback of these systems is that
	they are independent self-contained units, and as such, they do not
	directly take advantage of patient data. The potential of these new
	surgical tools lies much further ahead. Integration with medical
	imaging and information are needed for these devices to achieve their
	true potential. Surgical robots and especially their subclass of
	image-guided systems require special design, construction and control
	compared to industrial types, due to the special requirements of
	the medical and imaging environments. Imager compatibility raises
	significant engineering challenges for the development of robotic
	manipulators with respect to imager access, safety, ergonomics, and
	above all the non-interference with the functionality of the imager.
	These apply to all known medical imaging types, but are especially
	challenging for achieving compatibility with the class of MRI systems.
	Even though a large majority of robotic components may be redesigned
	to be constructed of MRI compatible materials, for other components
	such as the motors used in actuation, prescribing MRI compatible
	materials alone is not sufficient. The electromagnetic motors most
	commonly used in robotic actuation, for example, are incompatible
	by principle. As such, alternate actuation principles using "intervention
	friendly" energy should be adopted and/or devised for these special
	surgical and radiological interventions.This paper defines the new
	concept of Multi-Imager Compatibility of surgical manipulators and
	describes its requirements. Subsequently, the paper gives several
	recommendations and proposes new actuation principles for this concept.
	Several implementations have been constructed and tested, and the
	results are presented here. This is the first paper addressing these
	issues.},

	(US) enables accurate determination of pubic arch interference (PAI)
	for prostate brachytherapy (PBT); part 2, to compare the accuracy
	of transrectal US with that of computed tomography (CT) for PAI determination;
	and part 3, to determine the cost savings of PAI determination with
	transrectal US versus that with CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Part 1:
	The pubic arch was identified intraoperatively with transrectal US
	and compared with attempted needle passage (14 patients). Part 2:
	Planning CT with the patient supine was compared with planning transrectal
	US with patients in the dorsal lithotomy position (nine patients).
	Part 3: Cost savings were calculated for PAI determination with transrectal
	US versus that with CT (32 patients per group). RESULTS: Part 1:
	Transrectal US accurately showed the pubic arch relative to the prostate.
	Part 2: CT resulted in PAI overestimation by 11.8 mm. Part 3: Cost
	savings with transrectal US were $1,465 per patient. CONCLUSION:
	Transrectal US PAI determination is easily performed, intraoperatively
	useful, and accurate. CT can result in PAI overestimation. Reducing
	direct CT costs and the indirect costs of unnecessary hormonal therapy
	for false-positive PAI will reduce expense and improve patient care.
	Transrectal US should replace CT for PAI determination.},

	AND METHODS: In 5 patients with previously diagnosed prostate cancer,
	MRI guided intraprostatic placement of gold fiducial markers (4 procedures)
	and/or prostate biopsy (3 procedures) was performed using local anesthesia.
	RESULTS: Mean procedure duration was 76 minutes and all patients
	tolerated the intervention well. Procedure related adverse events
	included self-limited hematuria and hematochezia following 3 of 8
	procedures (all resolved in less than 1 week). Mean needle placement
	accuracy was 1.9 mm for the fiducial marker placement studies and
	1.8 mm for the biopsy procedures. Mean fiducial marker placement
	accuracy was 4.8 mm and the mean fiducial marker placement accuracy
	transverse to the needle direction was 2.6 mm. All patients who underwent
	the procedure were able to complete their course of radiotherapy
	without delay or complication. CONCLUSIONS: While studies of clinical
	usefulness are warranted, transrectal 1.5 T MRI guided prostate biopsy
	and fiducial marker placement is feasible using this system, providing
	new opportunities for image guided diagnostic and therapeutic prostate
	interventions.},

	stereotaxy and microsurgery in an imaging environment. To fulfill
	this niche, we have designed and manufactured an image-guided robotic
	system that is compatible with magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS:
	The system conveys the sight, touch, and sound of surgery to an operator
	seated at a remote workstation. Motion scaling, tremor filtering,
	and precision robotics allow surgeons to rapidly attain technical
	proficiency while working at a spatial resolution of 50 to 100 microm
	instead of a few millimeters. This system has the potential to shift
	surgery from the organ toward the cellular level. RESULTS: By integrating
	the robot with images obtained during the procedure, the effects
	of surgery on both the lesion and brain are immediately revealed.
	CONCLUSION: We are providing technology to advance and transform
	surgery with the potential to improve patient outcome.},

	information, such as grip force, enables more precise investigations
	in studies of motor function. However, conventional force sensors
	cannot be used in fMRI environment, since metal elements generate
	noise which severely contaminate the signals of fMRI. An optical
	2-axis force sensor has been developed using photo sensors and optical
	fibers by Tada et. al.(2002), that resolved these problems. The developed
	force sensor removed all magnetic components from the sensing part.
	It detected minute displacements by measure amount of light and light
	traveled through the optical fibers. However, there still remain
	several problems on this optical force sensor. Firstly, the accuracy
	is not high compared to the conventional force sensors. Secondly,
	the robustness is not enough against the contact force to the optical
	fibers. In this paper, the problems concerning to the accuracy and
	the sensor output stability has been improved by novel methods of
	fixing fibers and arithmetic circuit. Furthermore, an optical 6-axis
	force sensor is developed based on these improvements, and usefulness
	of our sensor for brain function analysis is confirmed in fMRI experimentations},

	removing the cement and fitting a new implant into an enlarged canal
	broached in the femur. RTHR surgery is a difficult procedure fraught
	with technical challenges and a high incidence of complications.
	The goals of the computer-based system are the significant reduction
	of cement removal labor and time, the elimination of cortical wall
	penetration and femur fracture, the improved positioning and fit
	of the new implant resulting from precise, high-quality canal milling
	and the reduction of bone sacrificed to fit the new implant. Our
	starting points are the ROBODOC system for primary hip replacement
	surgery and the manual RTHR surgical protocol. We first discuss the
	main difficulties of computer-integrated RTHR surgery and identify
	key issues and possible solutions. We then describe possible system
	architectures and protocols for preoperative planning and intraoperative
	execution. We present a summary of methods and preliminary results

	as part of a surgical procedure for bladder pathologic findings agreed
	to participate in this study. All patients had normal digital rectal
	examination findings. Immediately before prostatectomy all patients
	underwent sextant biopsies. The location, amount, and Gleason grade
	of any cancer identified on the biopsies were recorded. After surgery,
	the prostate was serially sectioned. The location, grade, and volume
	of any prostatic adenocarcinoma identified was recorded and compared
	with the results of the biopsy specimens. RESULTS: There were 33
	patients without prostate cancer in either the biopsies or the prostatectomy
	specimen. No patients had cancer on the biopsies and no cancer in
	the prostatectomy specimen. In 6 patients, cancer was found in both
	the biopsies and the prostatectomy specimens; these cancers were
	0.9, 2.1, 2.8, 3. 1, 4.2, and 6.5 cc in volume. In the remaining
	4 patients, there was no cancer on the biopsies but the prostatectomy
	specimen revealed cancers of 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 2.5 cc. The overall
	sensitivity for sextant biopsies was 60.0\%, with a specificity of
	100\%. When only cancers greater than 2 cc or cancers in the peripheral
	zone were considered, the sensitivity rose to 83.3\% and 71.4\%,

	97.2\%, respectively). In contrast, when transition zone cancers
	were evaluated, the sensitivity fell to 33.3\%. CONCLUSIONS: Sextant
	biopsies are fairly sensitive for the detection of tumors greater
	than 2 cc and those in the peripheral zone; however, repeat biopsies
	should be strongly considered in patients with a high clinical suspicion

	results of these biopsies plays a central role in treatment decisions.
	This biopsy approach was originally described as sampling the prostate
	in the mid-lobe, parasagittal plane at the apex, mid-gland, and base,
	bilaterally. Morphometric analysis of prostate specimens has revealed
	that most clinically significant cancers are mainly located in the
	posterolateral aspect of the gland, not the mid-lobe. We sought to
	determine if cancer detection could be improved by obtaining more
	laterally placed biopsies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one patients
	underwent transrectal ultrasound with mid-lobe sextant as well as
	lateral sextant biopsies. Biopsy specimens were evaluated for Gleason
	grade and length of cancer present in each core. The mid-lobe and
	lateral biopsy results were then compared. RESULTS: Thirteen of 41
	patients (31.7\%) were found to have no cancer on either biopsy set.
	Cancer was detected by both the mid-lobe and the lateral biopsies
	in 19 patients (46.3\%). In 6 patients (14.6\%), only the lateral
	biopsies revealed cancer, and in 3 patients (7.3\%), only the mid-lobe
	biopsies revealed cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Laterally-placed systematic
	sextant biopsies may yield an improved diagnosis rate in patients
	with palpable nodularity in the lateral aspect of the prostate, patients
	without any palpable abnormalities but with elevated PSA levels,
	and in those patients undergoing repeat biopsies.},

	(MR) image-guided liver therapy enhances surgical guidance by fusing
	preoperative multimodality images with intraoperative images, or
	by fusing intramodality images to correlate serial intraoperative
	images to monitor the effect of therapy. The objective of this paper
	is to describe the application of navigator echo and projection profile
	matching to fast two-dimensional image registration for MR-guided
	liver therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtain navigator echoes
	along the read-out and phase-encoding directions by using modified
	gradient echo imaging. This registration is made possible by masking
	out the liver profile from the image and performing profile matching
	with cross-correlation or mutual information as similarity measures.
	The set of experiments include a phantom study with a 2.0-T experimental
	MR scanner, and a volunteer and a clinical study with a 0.5-T open-configuration
	MR scanner, and these evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of
	this method for liver therapy. RESULTS: Both the phantom and volunteer
	study indicate that this method can perform registration in 34 ms
	with root-mean-square error of 1.6 mm when the given misalignment
	of a liver is 30 mm. The clinical studies demonstrate that the method
	can track liver motion of up to approximately 40 mm. Matching profiles
	with cross-correlation information perform better than with mutual
	information in terms of robustness and speed. CONCLUSION: The proposed
	image registration method has potential clinical impact on and advantages
	for MR-guided liver therapy.},

	surgical procedures in MRI-guided surgery, a new 4-D MR imaging technique
	called "Adaptive 4-D Scan" has been proposed. The technique is designed
	to acquire a time series of volumetric 3-D images (4-D image) of
	cyclically moving organ, even in a low-field open-configuration MR
	scanner. A pre-operative 4-D image is acquired with respiratory phase
	parameter, which is monitored by using navigator-echo-based real-time
	tracking of the liver and diaphragm. During operation, the respiratory
	phase is again monitored in real-time, and a 3-D image, reflecting
	the current state of the target organ, is extracted from the pre-operative
	4-D image and provided to physicians as a pseudo real-time 3-D image.
	We implemented Adaptive 4-D Scan into a 0.5 Tesla open-configuration
	clinical MRI system for intervention. Phantom and volunteer studies
	were performed to assess feasibility of this technique, in terms
	of image quality, imaging time and position accuracy of the imaged
	subject. A 4-D image (matrix: 256 x 128 x 10 x 8) of cyclically moving

	imaged subject and the real subject was 2.3 mm, where the range of
	motion was 50 mm. 4-D image of the moving liver was also successfully
	acquired under near clinical condition. In conclusion, the study

	manipulator is composed of a three degree of freedom Cartesian motion
	system, which resides outside the gantry of the scanner, and serves
	as the holder and global positioner of a three degree of freedom
	arm which extends inside the gantry of the scanner At its distal
	end, the arm's end-effector can carry an interventional tool such
	as a biopsy needle, which can be advanced to a desired depth by means
	of a seventh degree of freedom. These seven degrees of freedom, provided
	by the entire assembly, offer extended manipulability to the device
	and a wide envelope of operation to the user, who can select a trajectory
	suitable for the procedure. The device is constructed of nonmagnetic
	and nonconductive fiberglass, and carbon fiber composite materials,
	to minimize artifacts and distortion on the MR images as well as
	eliminate effects on its operation from the high magnetic field and
	the fast switching magnetic field gradients used in MR imaging. A
	user interface was developed for man-in-the-loop control of the device
	using real-time MR images. The user interface fuses all sensor signals
	(MR and manipulator information) in a visualization, planning, and
	control command environment. Path planning is performed with graphical
	tools for setting the trajectory of insertion of the interventional
	tool using multislice and/or three dimensional MR images which are
	refreshed in real time. The device control is performed with an embedded
	computer which runs real-time control software. The manipulator compatibility

	bilateral pallidal stimulation for primary generalised dystonia in
	a prospective, controlled, multicentre study with 1 year of follow-up.
	Although long-term results have been reported by other groups, no
	controlled assessment of motor and non-motor results is available.
	In this prospective multicentre 3 year follow-up study, involving
	the same patients as those enrolled in the 1 year follow-up study,
	we assessed the effect of bilateral pallidal stimulation on motor
	impairment, disability, quality of life, cognitive performance, and
	mood. METHODS: We studied 22 patients with primary generalised dystonia
	after 3 years of bilateral pallidal stimulation. We compared outcome
	at 3 years with their status preoperatively and after 1 year of treatment.
	Standardised video recordings were scored by an independent expert.
	Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. FINDINGS: Motor
	improvement observed at 1 year (51\%) was maintained at 3 years (58\%).
	The improvement in quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire) was similar
	to that observed at 1 year. Relative to baseline and to the 1 year
	assessment, cognition and mood were unchanged 3 years after surgery,
	but slight improvements were noted in concept formation, reasoning,
	and executive functions. Pallidal stimulation was stopped bilaterally
	in three patients because of lack of improvement, technical dysfunction,
	and infection, and unilaterally in two patients because of electrode
	breakage and stimulation-induced contracture. No permanent adverse
	effects were observed. INTERPRETATION: Bilateral pallidal stimulation
	provides sustained motor benefit after 3 years. Mild long-term improvements
	in quality of life and attention were also observed.},

  abstract = {In prostate brachytherapy, an 18-gauge needle is used to implant radioactive
	seeds. This thin needle can be deflected from the preplanned trajectory
	in the prostate, potentially resulting in a suboptimum dose pattern
	and at times requiring repeated needle insertion to achieve optimal
	dosimetry. In this paper, we report on the evaluation of brachytherapy
	needle deflection and bending in test phantoms and two approaches
	to overcome the problem. First we tested the relationship between
	needle deflection and insertion depth as well as whether needle bending
	occurred. Targeting accuracy was tested by inserting a brachytherapy
	needle to target 16 points in chicken tissue phantoms. By implanting
	dummy seeds into chicken tissue phantoms under 3D ultrasound guidance,
	the overall accuracy of seed implantation was determined. We evaluated
	methods to overcome brachytherapy needle deflection with three different
	insertion methods: constant orientation, constant rotation, and orientation
	reversal at half of the insertion depth. Our results showed that
	needle deflection is linear with needle insertion depth, and that
	no noticeable bending occurs with needle insertion into the tissue
	and agar phantoms. A 3D principal component analysis was performed
	to obtain the population distribution of needle tip and seed position
	relative to the target positions. Our results showed that with the
	constant orientation insertion method, the mean needle targeting
	error was 2.8 mm and the mean seed implantation error was 2.9 mm.
	Using the constant rotation and orientation reversal at half insertion
	depth methods, the deflection error was reduced. The mean needle
	targeting errors were 0.8 and 1.2 mm for the constant rotation and
	orientation reversal methods, respectively, and the seed implantation
	errors were 0.9 and 1.5 mm for constant rotation insertion and orientation
	reversal methods, respectively.},

	as a selection factor for prostate brachytherapy. From 1997 to 1998,
	33 patients with a TRUS-based prostate volume greater than 50 cc
	were treated at the University of Washington by I-125 (144 Gy) or
	Pd-103 (115 Gy) implantation for prostatic carcinoma. These 33 patients
	comprised 7\% of the total implants performed. Each patient underwent
	a preimplant TRUS study in the lithotomy position, taking serial
	axial images of the prostate at 0.5 cm intervals from the base of
	the gland to the apex. The contours on the preimplant TRUS images
	were used to calculate the prostate volumes reported here. Only one
	patient received supplemental external beam irradiation prior to
	implantation. Twelve patients were treated with neoadjuvant androgen
	ablation prior to implantation. The prostate volumes quoted here
	are those taken after hormonal downsizing. Postimplant axial CT images
	were digitized to calculate the CT-based target coverage. Preimplant
	urinary obstructive symptoms were quantified by the criteria of the
	American Urologic Association. Each patient was contacted at the
	time of this article preparation to update postimplant morbidity
	information. In all cases, at least 80\% of the postimplant volume
	was covered, despite a median implant-related volume increase of
	15\%. Five of the 33 patients' postimplant CT scans showed some degree
	of incomplete target coverage of the anterior/lateral prostate margin.
	There was no clear association between inadequate anterior/lateral
	coverage and the degree of interference. Twelve of the 33 patients
	developed acute postimplant urinary retention, all occurring within
	24 hr of implantation. Within this group of 33 patients with a large
	prostate volume, there was no relationship between the likelihood
	of acute or chronic urinary retention and preimplant prostate size
	or obstructive symptoms. Patients who developed postimplant retention
	lasting more than one week were generally managed by intermittent
	self-catheterization. By one month, 85\% of patients were catheter-free.
	Based on the data reported here, we are more inclined to accept patients
	with a large prostate for implantation without insisting on preimplant
	size reduction. Int. J. Cancer (Radiat. Oncol. Invest.) 90, 199-205

	we have developed robotic systems that actively steer a needle in

	insertion, and steering is enhanced when the needle is very flexible.
	An experimental needle steering robot was designed that includes
	force/torque sensing, horizontal needle insertion, stereo image data
	acquisition, and controlled actuation of needle rotation and translation.
	Experiments were performed with a phantom tissue to determine the
	effects of insertion velocity and bevel tip angle on the needle path,
	as well as the forces acting on the needle during insertion. Results
	indicate that needle steering inside tissue does not depend on insertion
	velocity, but does depend on bevel tip angle. In addition, the forces
	acting on the needle are directly related to the insertion velocity.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) concerns are pivotal
	in choosing prostate cancer therapy. However, concurrent HRQOL comparison
	between brachytherapy, external radiation, radical prostatectomy,
	and controls is hitherto lacking. HRQOL effects of hormonal adjuvants
	and of cancer control after therapy also lack prior characterization.
	PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered to
	patients who underwent brachytherapy, external-beam radiation, or
	radical prostatectomy during 4 years at an academic medical center
	and to age-matched controls. HRQOL among controls was compared with
	therapy groups. Comparison between therapy groups was performed using
	regression models to control covariates. HRQOL effects of cancer
	progression were evaluated. RESULTS: One thousand fourteen subjects
	participated. Compared with controls, each therapy group reported
	bothersome sexual dysfunction; radical prostatectomy was associated
	with adverse urinary HRQOL; external-beam radiation was associated
	with adverse bowel HRQOL; and brachytherapy was associated with adverse
	urinary, bowel, and sexual HRQOL (P [\&lt;=] .0002 for each). Hormonal
	adjuvant symptoms were associated with significant impairment (P
	< .002). More than 1 year after therapy, several HRQOL outcomes were
	less favorable among subjects after brachytherapy than after external
	radiation or radical prostatectomy. Progression-free subjects reported
	better sexual and hormonal HRQOL than subjects with increasing prostate-specific
	antigen (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Long-term HRQOL after prostate brachytherapy
	showed no benefit relative to radical prostatectomy or external-beam
	radiation and may be less favorable in some domains. Hormonal adjuvants
	can be associated with significant impairment. Progression-free survival
	is associated with HRQOL benefits. These findings facilitate patient
	counseling regarding HRQOL expectations and highlight the need for
	prospective studies sensitive to urinary irritative and hormonal
	concerns in addition to incontinence, sexual, and bowel HRQOL domains.

	within fluoroscopic images. Unlike previous distortion correction
	devices, the plate does not completely obscure any part of the image,
	and the distortion correction algorithm works well even when there

	are a novel corkscrew fiducial object designed to be integrated with
	the robot end-effector, and a 6D pose estimation algorithm based
	on the two-dimensional (2D) projection of the corkscrew, used in
	robot-imager registration and imager co-registration. (3) In addition,
	we develop a cavity location algorithm, which utilizes image subtraction
	and 2D anatomy contour registration techniques. (4) Finally, we propose
	a progressive cut refinement strategy, which progressively improves
	the robot registration during the procedure. We have conducted several

	advantages and disadvantages. Evidence-based guidelines on the use
