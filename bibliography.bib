	abstract = {{BackgroundThe} use of laparoscopic and robotic procedures has increased in general surgery. Minimally invasive robotic surgery has made tremendous progress in a relatively short period of time, realizing improvements for both the patient and surgeon. This has led to an increase in the use and development of robotic devices and platforms for general surgery. The purpose of this review is to explore current and emerging surgical robotic technologies in a growing and dynamic environment of research and development.{MethodsThis} review explores medical and surgical robotic endoscopic surgery and peripheral technologies currently available or in development. The devices discussed here are specific to general surgery, including laparoscopy, colonoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Benefits and limitations of each technology were identified and applicable future directions were described.{ResultsA} number of {FDA}-approved devices and platforms for robotic surgery were reviewed, including the da Vinci Surgical System, Sensei X Robotic Catheter System, {FreeHand} 1.2, invendoscopy E200 system, Flex® Robotic System, Senhance, {ARES}, the Single-Port Instrument Delivery Extended Research ({SPIDER}), and the {NeoGuide} Colonoscope. Additionally, platforms were reviewed which have not yet obtained {FDA} approval including {MiroSurge}, {ViaCath} System, {SPORT}™ Surgical System, {SurgiBot}, Versius Robotic System, Master and Slave Transluminal Endoscopic Robot, Verb Surgical, Miniature In Vivo Robot, and the Einstein Surgical Robot.{ConclusionsThe} use and demand for robotic medical and surgical platforms is increasing and new technologies are continually being developed. New technologies are increasingly implemented to improve on the capabilities of previously established systems. Future studies are needed to further evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each robotic surgical device and platform in the operating suite.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The da Vinci® surgical platform is becoming increasingly available and utilized. Due to the lack of haptic feedback, visual cues are necessary to estimate grip forces and tissue tensions during surgery. We directly measured the grip forces of robotic {EndoWrist}® instruments using the three available da Vinci robotic surgical platforms. Methods: Robotic instruments were tested in the da Vinci S, Si, and Standard systems. A load cell was placed in a housing unit that allowed for measurement of the grip forces applied by the tip of each robotic instrument. Each instrument was tested six times, and all data were analyzed using Student's t-tests or analysis of variance when appropriate. Results: Slight differences in grip force were seen when the instrument was tested through 2 degrees of freedom at the tip (p = 0.02, analysis of variance) and when comparing a new instrument to an older instrument (p = 0.001 at the neutral position). There was no statistical difference in grip force between the left and right robotic arms. There was a broad range of grip forces between the various robotic instruments. The lowest grip force was registered in the double fenestrated grasper (2.26 ± 0.15 N), whereas the highest was seen in the Hem-o-lok® clip applier (39.92 ± 0.89 N). In comparison to the S and Si, the Standard platform appeared to have significantly higher grip forces. Conclusion: Different grip forces were observed among the various robotic instruments commonly used during urologic surgery and between the Standard and the S and Si platforms.},

	abstract = {Background
Direct haptic (force or tactile) feedback is negligible in current surgical robotic systems. The relevance of haptic feedback in robot-assisted performances of surgical tasks is controversial. We studied the effects of visual force feedback ({VFF}), a haptic feedback surrogate, on tying surgical knots with fine sutures similar to those used in cardiovascular surgery.

Methods
Using a modified da Vinci robotic system (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.) equipped with force-sensing instrument tips and real-time {VFF} overlays in the console image, ten surgeons each tied 10 knots with and 10 knots without {VFF}. Four surgeons had significant prior da Vinci experience while the remaining six surgeons did not. Performance parameters, including suture breakage and secure knots, peak and standard deviation of applied forces, and completion times using 5-0 silk sutures were recorded. Chi-square and Student’s t-test analyses determined differences between groups.

Results
Among surgeon subjects with robotic experience, no differences in measured performance parameters were found between robot-assisted knot ties executed with and without {VFF}. Among surgeons without robotic experience, however, {VFF} was associated with lower suture breakage rates, peak applied forces, and standard deviations of applied forces. {VFF} did not impart differences in knot completion times or loose knots for either surgeon group.

Conclusions
{VFF} resulted in reduced suture breakage, lower forces, and decreased force inconsistencies among novice robotic surgeons, although elapsed time and knot quality were unaffected. In contrast, {VFF} did not affect these metrics among experienced da Vinci surgeons. These results suggest that {VFF} primarily benefits novice robot-assisted surgeons, with diminishing benefits among experienced surgeons.},

	abstract = {Background
Virtual reality ({VR}) as surgical training tool has become a state-of-the-art technique in training and teaching skills for minimally invasive surgery ({MIS}). Although intuitively appealing, the true benefits of haptic ({VR} training) platforms are unknown. Many questions about haptic feedback in the different areas of surgical skills (training) need to be answered before adding costly haptic feedback in {VR} simulation for {MIS} training. This study was designed to review the current status and value of haptic feedback in conventional and robot-assisted {MIS} and training by using virtual reality simulation.

Methods
A systematic review of the literature was undertaken using {PubMed} and {MEDLINE}. The following search terms were used: Haptic feedback {OR} Haptics {OR} Force feedback {AND}/{OR} Minimal Invasive {SurgeryAND}/{OR} Minimal Access Surgery {AND}/{OR} Robotics {AND}/{OR} Robotic Surgery {AND}/{OR} Endoscopic Surgery {AND}/{OR} Virtual Reality {AND}/{OR} Simulation {OR} Surgical Training/Education.

Results
The results were assessed according to level of evidence as reflected by the Oxford Centre of Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence.

Conclusions
In the current literature, no firm consensus exists on the importance of haptic feedback in performing minimally invasive surgery. Although the majority of the results show positive assessment of the benefits of force feedback, results are ambivalent and not unanimous on the subject. Benefits are least disputed when related to surgery using robotics, because there is no haptic feedback in currently used robotics. The addition of haptics is believed to reduce surgical errors resulting from a lack of it, especially in knot tying. Little research has been performed in the area of robot-assisted endoscopic surgical training, but results seem promising. Concerning {VR} training, results indicate that haptic feedback is important during the early phase of psychomotor skill acquisition.},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review
Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery ({RMIS}) holds great promise for improving the accuracy and dexterity of a surgeon while minimizing trauma to the patient. However, widespread clinical success with {RMIS} has been marginal. It is hypothesized that the lack of haptic (force and tactile) feedback presented to the surgeon is a limiting factor. This review explains the technical challenges of creating haptic feedback for robot-assisted surgery and provides recent results that evaluate the effectiveness of haptic feedback in mock surgical tasks.

Recent Findings
Haptic feedback systems for {RMIS} are still under development and evaluation. Most provide only force feedback, with limited fidelity. The major challenge at this time is sensing forces applied to the patient. A few tactile feedback systems for {RMIS} have been created, but their practicality for clinical implementation needs to be shown. It is particularly difficult to sense and display spatially distributed tactile information. The cost-benefit ratio for haptic feedback in {RMIS} has not been established.

Summary
The designs of existing commercial {RMIS} systems are not conducive for force feedback, and creative solutions are needed to create compelling tactile feedback systems. Surgeons, engineers, and neuroscientists should work together to develop effective solutions for haptic feedback in {RMIS}.},

	abstract = {Objective

The primary objectives of this rapid assessment were to assess the clinical evidence of Da Vinci surgical system ({DVSS}) comparing with open procedures and laparoscopic procedures, and in order to provide the evidence for health decision makers and clinician.


Methods

A comprehensive search of electronic databases ({EMbase}, {PubMed}, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, {CNKI}, {VIP}, {CBM} and Wanfang) and {HTA} websites were completed up to 9 October, 2013. Two reviews (Jiajie Yu and Yingqiang Wang) independently extracted data of the manuscripts, and assessed quality of included studies using {AMSTAR} tools. Qualitative description and {GRADE} were used to report the outcomes and evidence quality.


Outcomes

A total of 17 studies were included: 3 were {HTA} and 14 were {SR}/meta-analysis. The included studies focused on prostatectomy, nephrectomy, hysterectomy colorectal surgery, and cardiac surgery. {DVSS} was shown to be associated with statistically significant reduction in length of hospital stay, blood loss, and transfusion rate compared with open and laparoscopic surgery, but increase in operative time when compared with open surgery.


Conclusion

Based on the evidence included in this rapid assessment, {DVSS} has a limited impact on several clinical outcomes. Considering no available data from randomized controlled trials and much higher cost, decisions will be complex and need to be made carefully. Decision makers should cut down the quantity of purchasing and reasonable allocate them.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel concept of two-degree-of-freedom (2-{DOF}) compliant forceps is suggested for the measure of pulling and grasp forces at the tip of surgical instrument for minimally invasive surgery robot. For the design of the compliant forceps, the required compliance characteristics are first defined using a simple spring model with one linear and one torsional springs. This model may be directly realized as the compliant forceps. However, for the compact realization of the mechanism, we synthesize the spring model with two torsional springs that has equivalent compliance characteristics to the linear-torsional spring model. Then, each of the synthesized torsional springs is realized physically by means of a flexure hinge. From this design approach, direct measurement of the pulling and grasp forces is possible at the forceps, and measuring sensitivity can be adjusted in the synthesis process. The validity of the design is evaluated by finite element analysis. Further, from the measured values of bending strains of two flexure hinges, a method to compute the decoupled pulling and grasp forces is presented via the theory of screws. Finally, force-sensing performance of the proposed compliant forceps is verified from the experiments of the prototype using some weights and load cells.},

	abstract = {Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgeries have gained a lot of popularity over conventional procedures as they offer many benefits to both surgeons and patients. Nonetheless, they still suffer from some limitations that affect their outcome. One of them is the lack of force feedback which restricts the surgeon's sense of touch and might reduce precision during a procedure. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel force estimation approach that combines a vision based solution with supervised learning to estimate the applied force and provide the surgeon with a suitable representation of it. The proposed solution starts with extracting the geometry of motion of the heart's surface by minimizing an energy functional to recover its 3D deformable structure. A deep network, based on a {LSTM}-{RNN} architecture, is then used to learn the relationship between the extracted visual-geometric information and the applied force, and to find accurate mapping between the two. Our proposed force estimation solution avoids the drawbacks usually associated with force sensing devices, such as biocompatibility and integration issues. We evaluate our approach on phantom and realistic tissues in which we report an average root-mean square error of 0.02 N.},

	abstract = {In robot assisted laparoscopic surgery using a commercialized robot, such as the da Vinci, surgeons have encountered problems, such as organ impairment, because they depend only on visual information. To solve these problems, a haptic system is required. Force feedback and a bilateral control system are essential for realizing a haptic teleoperation system. The use of a force/torque sensor for force feedback is difficult in a surgical robot instrument, but previous studies confirmed that the reaction force loaded on a surgical robot instrument can be estimated using a sliding perturbation observer ({SPO})-based reaction force estimation method. This paper suggests a bilateral controller applying {SPO} based force estimation method to realize the possibility of a haptic function in a laparoscopic surgery robot system. In the suggested bilateral controller, the master control uses impedance control and the slave control uses a sliding mode control ({SMC}). A torque and force sensorless teleoperation system can be implemented using the suggested bilateral control structure through an experimental evaluation.},

	abstract = {{BackgroundRobotic} surgical platforms have seen increased use among minimally invasive gastrointestinal surgeons (von Fraunhofer et al. in J Biomed Mater Res 19(5):595–600, 1985. doi: 10.1002/jbm.820190511). However, these systems still suffer from lack of haptic feedback, which results in exertion of excessive force, often leading to suture failures (Barbash et al. in Ann Surg 259(1):1–6, 2014. doi: 10.1097/{SLA}.0b013e3182a5c8b8). This work catalogs tensile strength and failure load among commonly used sutures in an effort to prevent robotic surgical consoles from exceeding identified thresholds. Trials were thus conducted on common sutures varying in material type, gauge size, rate of pulling force, and method of applied force.{MethodsPolydioxanone}, Silk, Vicryl, and Prolene, gauges 5-0 to 1-0, were pulled till failure using a commercial mechanical testing system. 2-0 and 3-0 sutures were further tested for the effect of pull rate on failure load at rates of 50, 200, and 400 mm/min. 3-0 sutures were also pulled till failure using a da Vinci robotic surgical system in unlooped, looped, and at the needle body arrangements.{ResultsGenerally}, Vicryl and {PDS} sutures had the highest mechanical strength (47–179 {kN}/cm2), while Silk had the lowest (40–106 {kN}/cm2). Larger diameter sutures withstand higher total force, but finer gauges consistently show higher force per unit area. The difference between material types becomes increasingly significant as the diameters decrease. Comparisons of identical suture materials and gauges show 27–50\% improvement in the tensile strength over data obtained in 1985 (Ballantyne in Surg Endosc Other Interv Tech 16(10):1389–1402, 2002. doi: 10.1007/s00464-001-8283-7). No significant differences were observed when sutures were pulled at different rates. Reduction in suture strength appeared to be strongly affected by the technique used to manipulate the suture.{ConclusionsAvailability} of suture tensile strength and failure load data will help define software safety protocols for alerting a surgeon prior to suture failure during robotic surgery. Awareness of suture strength weakening with direct instrument manipulation may lead to the development of better techniques to further reduce intraoperative suture breakage.},

	abstract = {In minimally invasive surgery ({MIS}) the patient's skin forms a spatial barrier between the operation area and the surgeon. This prevents direct access to the operation site which causes a lack of dexterity and limits the sensation of tissue manipulation forces, therefore complicating {MIS} procedures significantly. A telepresence approach can overcome these limitations: Additional degrees of freedom ({DoF}) inside the patient provide full manipulability and force torque sensors at the distal end of the instrument allow precise measurement of interaction forces. Using a suitable man-machine interface and free cartesian motion kinaesthetic feedback can be achieved, thus providing a virtual open surgery environment to the surgeon. This article focuses on the development and first results of actuated and sensor integrated instruments as part of the {DLR} minimally invasive robotic surgery ({MIRS}) setup. The instruments as a front-end part of the {MIRS} setup form one base of a telepresence working environment and are crucial for semi-autonomous functions, e.g. motion compensation.
