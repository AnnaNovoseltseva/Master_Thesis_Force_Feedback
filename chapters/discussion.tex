Some of the requirements for the device were satisfied. However, some of the major ones were not, meaning that the devices need further improvements.
	
	Both devices should undergo sterilization. One of the devices goes inside the patient, meaning that it should be created using biocompatible materials. Current version of the device is not biocompatible. We can achieve biocompatibilty by using Stainless Steel as a device material and biocompatible epoxy to cover strain gauges, also teflon coated wires should be used for all electrical connections. Use of stainless steel will require change of the device dimensions, since the material has different elasticity. Also, epoxy cover can alter readings results.
	
	The real-time haptic feedback requires minimum data acquisition speed to be 1 kHz \cite{seungmoon_choi_effect_2004}. However, the current maximum speed is 588 Hz due to limitation of data transfers speed using serial communication with computer (115.2 Kbps). In order to increase the speed, we can change the communication channel to SPI (up to 10 Mbps) \cite{_uart_porotocol} or one of the wireless protocols, such as Bluetooth (up tp 1 Mbps) or wifi (up to 100 Mbps) \cite{_wireless_protocols}. Also, communication protocol between microcontroller and ADC can be changed from SPI to faster parallel communication. Additionally, the microcontroller can be changed to faster one, so it can support wireless communication.
	All these changes require change of PCB design and microcontroller software. Also, in the PCB the amount of Wheatstone bridges and ADCs should be increased from 2 to 4 to decrease the overall size of the system by removing second PCB and master-slave communication.
	
	The designed devices measure forces in slightly higher than $\pm 11 N$ range. When the applied force exceeds the specified range, the device redaings can be used to trigger safety alert.
	
	The required resolution should be at least 0.3 N and have error less than 0.05 N \cite{mack_interactive_2012}.
	

We can use QTC-pills in future, promising approach, higher sensitivity 
	
	 The system has separate wheatstone bridges for each direction, giving ability to measure each component of the force independently. At the same time tool can rotate freely and changing the insertion depth.	
	
	Strain gauges have linear response with deformation. Our calibration results have shown linearity of the readings.

	Force-sensing devices were designed to fit daVinci cannula and sterile adapter and compensate tolerances by adjustment of set screws.

SNR values for all systems are bigger than 1, meaning that all systems have relatively low noise.

Figure \ref{fig:Syst_err} shows X-component of the force measured with created device and using load cell. SNR of the system is high  it can be assumed that fluctuations in the output signal are due to systematic errors. 

For Z-direction device we got wide range of forces, because we cannot get high electronic gain, since the sensor is unbalanced caused by mechanical preloading of the sensor plate.

Temperature dependence is not appropriate to do, since we have big systematic errors. First priority will be remove systematic errors.

This is our conclusion)

For future work ..
However, disadvantages would be addition of the cost to already expensive system and possible biocompaitibily and sterilization issues. Also addition of the weight to the arm could alter robot performance, however, since the device will be placed close to center of rotation of the robot arm, it will have minimal affect on the moment of inertia  in comparison to sensors added to the grippers.

Z-direction. We tried to measure force in Z-direction, but unfortunately results shown that developed system was not accurate and sensitive enough. To improve system we can suggest to change strain gauges to more sensitive ones. Since we have small room for deformation - around 0.3 mm, we can not afford more deformation by using thinner or longer plates. Therefore, we decided to use motor current readings for z-directional reading of the force.
