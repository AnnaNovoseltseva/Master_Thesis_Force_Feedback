Biocompatibility and coatings

Sterilization techniques

Z-direction

Increase speed form 588 Hz to something higher by change ADC from SPI 

communication to parallel communication. Right now maximum frequency is 250ksps, which is 250k/32 = 7.812 KBps.

 Change communication channel bw microcontroller and PC to faster one. Right now we use serial port, with max speed 7.1 KBps 
 
Change microcontroller to the faster one. 

We can use QTC-pills in future, promising approach, higher sensitivity
