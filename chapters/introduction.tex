Teleoperated da Vinci surgical system is a robot-assisted surgical 
system that enhances surgeons performance in minimally invasive surgeries by 
allowing highly precise translation of surgeon`s hand movements to the instrument's movements. 

The currently available da Vinci surgery system 
has a laparoscopic camera, providing visual feedback to guide doctors during 
surgery. However, the system does not have any kinesthetic or cutaneous feedback, 
known as haptics.\cite{_intuitive_2018} 


During open surgeries, doctors usually get haptic feedback directly or through 
the surgical tools. In minimally invasive surgeries interaction with patients 
via long shafts leads to the loss of some force and tactile sense. In robotic 
surgery systems, surgeons have to manipulate robots indirectly, which leads to 
an elimination of any haptic feedback. \cite{okamura_haptic_2009} 

It is believed that the addition of haptic feedback in the da Vinci surgery 
robot will help to reduce the amount of surgical errors and intra-operative 
injuries, which will lead to faster post-surgery recovery time and decreased 
rate of unsuccessful surgeries. \cite{reiley_effects_2008, van_der_meijden_value_2009, okamura_haptic_2009}

There are many technical challenges to overcome in 
order to implement the haptic feedback in da Vinci robot. One of them is 
getting accurate force readings from the patient side manipulator (PSM). 
To address this issue, we are trying to create force-feedback device, that can 
be easily added to the existing surgery system.
