The daVinci surgical system is a robotic platform that enhances surgeons performance in minimally invasive surgeries by enabling highly precise translation of surgeon`s hand movements to the instrument's movements. 

The currently available daVinci surgery system 
has a laparoscopic camera, providing visual feedback to guide doctors during surgery. However, the system does not have any kinesthetic or cutaneous feedback, known as haptics \cite{_intuitive_2018}.


During open surgeries, doctors usually get haptic feedback directly or through the surgical tools. In minimally invasive surgeries interaction with patients via long shafts leads to the loss of some force and tactile sense. In robotic surgery systems, surgeons have to manipulate robots indirectly, which eliminates all haptic feedback \cite{okamura_haptic_2009}.

Several studies \cite{wagner_benefit_2007, yiasemidou_faster_2011, currie_role_2017} have proved that the addition of haptic feedback in the daVinci surgery robot will help to reduce the amount of surgical errors and intra-operative injuries, which will lead to faster post-surgery recovery time and decreased rate of unsuccessful surgeries \cite{reiley_effects_2008, van_der_meijden_value_2009, okamura_haptic_2009}.

There are many technical challenges to overcome in order to implement the haptic feedback in the daVinci robot. One of them is getting accurate force readings from the patient side manipulator (PSM). To address this issue, we are trying to create force-sensing device, that can be easily added to the existing surgery system.
