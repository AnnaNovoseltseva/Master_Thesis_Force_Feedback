		At present, the da Vinci surgical system does not provide haptic feedback.

	procedure
	In this work, two force-sensing devices were designed for patent side manipulator of da Vinci surgical robot. One of them to measure forces in X-Y direction, another one in Z-direction. These devices were designed to be easily added to existing system. Combination of these devices can be used for creation of real-time haptic feedback in the da Vinci robot.
	
	results
	Designed instrument have shown high sensitivity and is compliant with required force measurement range. However, absolute errors of the present force-sensing device is high, in X-direction is $-0.075 \pm 0.427 N$, in Y-direction is $0.1 \pm  0.9 N$, in Z-direction is $-0.005 \pm 0.952 N$. Those errors are systematic and could be related to high hysteresis of the system.
	
	conclusions
	
	Many things to be changed (add Z-direction, biocompatibility)
